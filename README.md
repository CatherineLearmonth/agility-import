Agility PIM Import

This is an extension for Magento 2. 

The extension requires an xml input from Agility PIM syndication to create attributes, attribute sets, products and categories automatically in Magento. The extension also handles incremental changes such as add, update, delete, move, link and unlink. 

To get the xml input, you will require the Agility PIM, along with Agility PIM's syndication server, full exporter and adapter code. 

With the introduction of this extension, Agility PIM and Magento provide an integrated digital suite encompassing Product Content Management, Experience Management and Commerce.
