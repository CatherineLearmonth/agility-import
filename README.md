Agility PIM Import

This is an extension for Magento 2. 

The extension requires an xml input from Agility syndication to create attributes, attribute sets, products and categories automatically in Magento. The extension also handles incremental changes such as update, delete, move, link and unlink. 

To get the xml input, you will require the Agility PIM, along with Agility's syndication server, full exporter and adapter code. If you need a PIM system along with Magento, then this extension with Agility is the ideal solution.
